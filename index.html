      <h2>About Litnerd letters</h2>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by one of my friends who is a medical student
        and likes writing articles.He earlier inquired from me how he can create
        a website to write and post his articles in. I recommended an online web
        builder. I purposed to build my own custom version of the same when I
        learned the skills to do so.So the naming of the project and the idea
        generally came from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm slowly adding features to the site before fully deploying it. And
        maybe later, I will provide him an avenue to write and share his
        articles, plus many other people. I leveraged this opportunity to learn
        as I apply the skills in this project. I'm slowly developing it and
        adding several functionalities, making sure it is excellent.
